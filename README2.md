The profile page is the central hub for the user. Here they can create a unique page where they can show off their skills, connections, controbutions to the forum, message other users, post their thoughts and ideas, and have others endorse their skills. when someone else finds the users page on the forum or map they are directed here. 

Unfortunatly this code needs a great deal of work as many of its ideas and features are not implemented.
