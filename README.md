repo_team2

This code shows the backend description of how we can find events in the same city as we are in. 

Certain features include being able to : Find an event on the same day, finding an event in the same city, 
adding cities and events that are not on the list, being able to search events by categories of interest. If given time, 
we would add a similar function as add event to be able to add categories people may be interested in. 

This code can also be implemented for people (possible leaders in the same city), and for 
jobs (the list of jobs available in the same city as you), and much more. 

This code is a basic idea of mapping various events, people and jobs around you to create a culture of 
connecting people and making it easier for them to share their expertise and talents with each other
